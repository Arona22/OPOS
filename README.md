Orri Egilsson (holmiegils@ru.is) and Kristófer Orri Svavarsson 
(kristofers21@ru.is).

The project is made for educational purposes only and is not inteded to be 
seen or used as a legitemate product.

Furtermore, the project was made by three junior web developers and thus 
the website might be subjected to bugs and/or not work as inteded. 

The project was made by the helping had of several web development services
like django and bootstrap, some of which are required for the installment and
use of the website (see requirements.txt for further information).

Additionally, the project was shipped with "Debug = True" in line 26 in
settings.py. This is because the developers ran into a problem when rinning
the appication with Debug set to False. It is advised to set Debug to False
for security purposes. If you do, please run the server with -insecure flag.
If that doesn't work, change line 28 from "ALLOWED_HOSTS = []" to 
"ALLOWED_HOSTS = []".

To contact the makers of this website, please use any of the emails listed 
above.
