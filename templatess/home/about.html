            <p class="about-informaion-text" style="margin-top: 20px;">A wise old man once said: "Pizza is not a 'trend'; it is a way of life." We at OPOS inc. 
                beleve the old man's statement in a litteral sence, for we would not live in the world we 
                have today would it not be for pizza. Hence it is our mission to bring pizza to as many 
                plates as we can.</p>
                
            <p class="about-informaion-text"> For three weeks the OPOS inc. team has labored tirelessly to bring  
                a pizza ordering system into fruition and it is with great pleasure to present the fruit 
                of that labor; this beautiful website. With interesting features and a bold design, it is
                sure to draw users attention.</p>
            
            <p class="about-informaion-text"> The OPOS inc. development team is composed of three cmputer science students at the 
                University of Reykjavík, Aron Andreassen, Hólmsteinn O. Egilsson and Kristófer O. Svavarsson.</p>
